Here I keep track of various applications I have used so far.
These are personal preferences.
I am building my personal preferences with these experiences.

# 1. Note Apps
## 1-1. Typora
* tips:
   * command + click => open url link
   * can use icloud drive to sync between devices
* what is awesome:
   * outline view
   * customizable themes: [How to develop custom theme](https://theme.typora.io/doc/Write-Custom-Theme/#lines)
   * can edit in plain view and preview view
* downside:
   * can't see filetree and outline at the same time. (need to toggle)
  
## 1-2. Evernote
* huge downside: 
   * no markdown support
   * export options are limited (HTML, .enex) (free plan)
* free plan: sync between 2 devices but web app available 

## 1-3. Notion
* to many functions.
* huge downside:
    * slow page loading
    * Notion uses markdown syntax that is a bit different from github's markdown syntax. (ex. links)
    * / opens up a command pallete(?) - which is inconvenient for fast writing.
    * export in markdown is available, but very-long-titles are generated.
* sync, web app available
* free plan: Notion removed block limits for the free plan. (educational plan available)

## 1-4. Bear
* what is awesome:
   * clean and pretty UI
   * tags
* downside:
   * to use syncing, need to pay.
   * markdown syntax bit different from that of github:
      * table is not supported
      * highlight syntax (::dfdf:: which is not available on github)
      * tag syntax is convenient, but not available in general markdown formats.
      * when pasting external link title is automatically generated...
   * notes are stored in local sqlite database.
